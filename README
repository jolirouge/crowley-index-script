## Updated 2013-11-14: GMOBster update!


## Change permissions to make the script executable:

chmod 755 make_index.pl

## Fix line endings if the text files were created on windows:

dos2unix 575.*

## Run the program like so:

./make_index.pl 575.1 575.2 575.3 575.4 575.5 575.6 > index.txt


## Optionally, open the index.txt  file in a word editor (like Libre Office) and add page numbers ( 1 of 24, for example).  This will help you keep the pages in order in case something unexpected happens.

#
# The _larry_version script is a user contributed change that addresses dos2unix, and deals gracefully with trailing semi-colons on lines.
