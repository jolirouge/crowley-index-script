## Updated 2013-03-25: something about larry


## Change permissions to make the script executable:

chmod 755 make_index.pl

## Fix line endings if the text files were created on windows:

dos2unix 401.*

## Run the program like so:

./make_index.pl 401.1 401.2 401.3 401.4 401.5 401.6 > index.txt


## Optionally, open the index.txt  file in a word editor (like Libre Office) and add page numbers ( 1 of 24, for example).  This will help you keep the pages in order in case something unexpected happens.
#
#
#
# The _larry_version script is a user contributed change that addresses dos2unix, and deals gracefully with trailing semi-colons on lines.
